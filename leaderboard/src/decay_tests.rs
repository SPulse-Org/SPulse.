// ── Issue #69: points decay, so a ranking reflects activity not history ──────
//
// The board used to be a cumulative counter — `points += n`, never down. An
// early adopter who stopped playing held their rank forever, because a
// newcomer had to out-earn their entire lifetime total to pass them.
//
// The test that matters here is not "points still go up". That passes against
// the old monotonic model too, so it proves nothing. The criterion is whether
// **the ranking can change without the newcomer out-earning the leader** — so
// these tests assert relative rank over simulated time, and the headline one
// is written so that the newcomer earns strictly less in absolute terms.
